# This default .ssh/config file was created with your home directory.
# You can customize it as you like; it will not be overwritten again.
#
# ssh configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. this file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.
#
# For more information about ssh options, see `man ssh`.
